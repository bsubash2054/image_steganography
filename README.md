**Group Project by:**

- Ajay Dhungel
- Dhananjaya Kafle
- Suvash Bhandari
- Ram Pukar Singh

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. This Flask application allows you to encode messages into images using steganography and decode hidden messages from images.

## Docker Build and Push (GitHub Actions Workflow) üê≥

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR on every push to the main branch.

### Docker Build and Push

- **Trigger:** Automatically runs on every push to the main branch.

#### Steps
1. **Checkout code:** Retrieves the code from the repository.
2. **Configure AWS credentials:** Configures AWS credentials for pushing to Amazon ECR.
3. **Login to Amazon ECR:** Logs in to the Amazon ECR registry.
4. **Get Git Commit ID:** Retrieves the Git commit ID for tagging the Docker image.
5. **Build, Tag, and Push the Image to Amazon ECR:**
   - Builds the Docker image.
   - Tags the image with the Git commit ID.
   - Pushes the image to Amazon ECR.
